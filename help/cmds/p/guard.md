**p guard**
Description: Used to guard a player

Usage: `!p guard <user>`. <user> is the mention/emoji of the player you want to threaten
Example: `!p guard @BenTechy66#8809`

**Notes:**
 - You (who must be a GM) are only allowed to use this command _after_ you've started the daily lynch polls
 - If someone has already voted for the player who is being guarded, you should manually inform them that they should change their vote
